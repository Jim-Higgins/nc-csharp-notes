# C# 101
C# is a general purpose, high-level programming language designed by Anders Hejlsberg and developed by him and his team as part of Microsoft. It was first introduced in 2000, and has had a series of updates with latest stable release in 2018. C# is part of the C family of languages, and will be familiar to anyone who has explored C, C++, Java or JavaScript before. It is predominantly used for software development, both desktop and mobile. It is also a popular language for gaming engines, with Unity using C# as its core language, as well as the Godot engine.
### Compiling C
C# is not as low level language as C and will also need to be compiled into bytecode before running. It is not interpreted, however, which adds a compulsory step before running our code - we need to _compile_ it, or _build_ it, into code that the runtime can more easily execute. This differs from JavaScript, an _interpreted_ language, which gets compiled "just in time" during the execution of a program. To run C# code, we therefore need a _runtime environment_ and a compiler.
The most popular runtime environment for C# is **.NET**, which comes in two flavours. The **.NET framework** comes pre-installed on any Windows machine. For other platforms, **.NET Core** is available be installed on any machine. Both runtime environments provide an open source compiler for C#, the development of which has been led by Microsoft and was previously known under the name "Roslyn". .NET Core is better set up for cross-platform support, and offers better support for Docker containers and microservices, so is probably a better candidate to learn. There are a few other considerations when choosing, detailed by Microsoft [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/choosing-core-framework-server).
Alternatives to using .NET include:
- **Mono** - another open source project backed by Microsoft, which follows the Common Language Infrastructure specifications, and includes nearly all implementations of the .NET class libraries. There are a number of services not included, and substitutes of others. Mono is the compiler used by Unity and other gaming engines. [Official website(https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/languages/csharp/)
- **Xamarin** - provides tools to develop cross-platform applications for mobile and desktop, using C# as codebase and compiling to native code. [Official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin)
### Visual Studio vs VS Code
Another consideration is the test editor you would like to use. Visual Studio is perhaps the most popular, as it provides immediate support for the language, with an in-built debugger. It also provides support for development with Xamarin.
If using VS Code, you will need to install [Microsoft's fairly fully-featured extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp), which includes many of the benefits you would get from Visual Studio like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and debugging support.
## Differences with JavaScript
Though JavaScript and C# are both [C family languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages), and therefore some structures will look familiar, there are many differences in how code is written and organised. Following is by no means exhaustive list of some of the key differences between the two, which might trip you up during the transition. There are many, many more but this provided a small flavour for now.
- C# can support functional programming, however it is primarily an imperative language utilising the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** paradigm. The `class` syntax in JS ES6 is designed to mimic C# classes. The way they work is structurally different, though many of the principles remain the same.
- C# is **strongly typed** (much like Typescript). In general, variables in C# are declared with a type:
```csharp
string greeting = "Hello world!";
```
- A variable cannot be assigned a value not of its type, or change type. When these restrictions are violated, an error is thrown by the compiler.
```csharp
string num = 42;
num = 'forty-two' // would cause an error.
```
- global variables or functions are not allowed - all variables and functions are therefore members of a `class`.
- What we know as _function_ in JavaScript are more commonly called _methods_ in C#, as they always exist as a _member_ of an object. Methods are also defined with a designated return value data type:
```csharp
string Greet(string name)
{
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
```
- Methods should be defined as returning `void` when they don't return anything; there's no `undefined` value in C#.
- `null` is also more complicated - as a general rule, primitives can't be assigned as `null`, whereas non-primitives can.
- `while` and `if` statements require a strict "true" or "false" value, unlike in JS where we can pass a number or a string, which will be interpreted as 'truthy' or 'falsy'.
- in C#, a primitive data type called `char` exists for single characters. Single quotes are used to encode a `char`, whereas double quotes encode a `string`.
- data type coercion is much more limited than in JavaScript, with very few operations being implicit and a few more coercions requiring explicit casting - [more details here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions).
- both variables and fields must have specific scoping declared: `public` variables are accessible outside their class whereas `private` variables are only accessible within their class.
- _variable shadowing_ is not allowed (this occurs when a variable of an inner scope is named the same as a variable in an outer scope; it's also called _variable masking_).
- variables can be declared with the keyword of the datatype they will hold, or we can rely on the compiler to do the data assignment for us using the `var` keyword:
```csharp
  public int num = 1; // explicitly assigned to hold a integer data type
  public var hello = "hello"; // will be assigned to a string data type
```
- `const` denotes a variable which cannot change, and is essentially read only. It does not replace `var` or an explicit type keyword:
  ```csharp
    public const int num = 1; // the value of num cannot be changed
    public const var hello = "hello"; // same for hello, we cannot reassign this value
  ```
